  abstract={Machine-learning models have recently encountered enormous success for predicting the properties of materials. These are often trained based on data that present various levels of accuracy, with typically much less high- than low-fidelity data. In order to extract as much information as possible from all available data, we here introduce an approach which aims to improve the quality of the data through denoising. We investigate the possibilities that it offers in the case of the prediction of the band gap using both limited experimental data and density-functional theory relying on different exchange-correlation functionals. After analyzing the raw data thoroughly, we explore different ways to combine the data into training sequences and analyze the effect of the chosen denoiser. We also study the effect of applying the denoising procedure several times until convergence. Finally, we compare our approach with various existing methods to exploit multi-fidelity data and show that it provides an interesting improvement.},

  abstract={Traditionally, chemistry problems are solved by means of a deductive approach. The question to be addressed is typically related to the value of a property that is either measured experimentally, computed using quantum-chemistry software, or (more recently) predicted using a machine-learned model. In this paper, we demonstrate that an inductive approach can be adopted using End-to-End (E2E) machine learning. This approach is illustrated for tackling the following chemistry problems: (i) determine the fully coordinated (FC) and undercoordinated (UC) atoms in a molecule with one missing atom, (ii) identify the type of atom that is missing in such an incomplete molecule, and (iii) predict the direction of a reaction between two molecules according to an existing dataset. The E2E approach leads to accuracies higher than 99%, 98%, and 93% for these three problems, respectively. Finally, in order to achieve such accuracies, a descriptor for the molecules, called bag of clusters, is introduced and compared with a series previously proposed descriptors, highlighting a series of advantages.},

  abstract={\(BaFe_1−xY_xO_3−δ\) (x=0–0.2) materials were synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction process for oxygen separation application. The effects of Y-doping on the crystal structure development, electrical conductivity and oxygen permeability were evaluated. Yttrium introduction effectively stabilize the cubic structure of BaFe1−xYxO3−δ. With Y-doping, the oxidation state of Fe ions reduces, resulting in the increase in oxygen vacancy concentration as charge compensation and the decreases in electrical conductivity. Y-doping enhances the structural stability of BaFe1−xYxO3−δ in reducing atmosphere but decreases the oxygen permeability. Both of them are attributed to the strong binding energy of Y–O bond. The cobalt free membrane BaFe0.95Y0.05O3−δ shows good structural stability under reducing atmosphere and acceptable oxygen permeation flux of 0.798 ml (STP) min−1 cm−2 at 900 °C for 1.1 mm thick membrane, making it a promising candidate for future practical applications.},

  abstract={The activation of CO on iron-based materials is a key elementary reaction for many chemical processes. We investigate CO adsorption and dissociation on a series of Fe, Fe3C, Fe5C2, and Fe2C catalysts through density functional theory calculations. We detect dramatically different performances for CO adsorption and activation on diverse surfaces and sites. The activation of CO is dependent on the local coordination of the molecule to the surface and on the bulk phase of the underlying catalyst. The bulk properties and the different local bonding environments lead to varying interactions between the adsorbed CO and the surface and thus yielding different activation levels of the C–O bond. We also examine the prediction of CO adsorption on different types of Fe-based catalysts by machine learning through linear regression models. We combine the features originating from surfaces and bulk phases to enhance the prediction of the activation energies and perform eight different linear regressions utilizing the feature engineering of polynomial representations. Among them, a ridge linear regression model with 2nd-degree polynomial feature generation predicted the best CO activation energy with a mean absolute error of 0.269 eV.},
