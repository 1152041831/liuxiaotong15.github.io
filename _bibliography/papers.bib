  abstract={Machine-learning models have recently encountered enormous success for predicting the properties of materials. These are often trained based on data that present various levels of accuracy, with typically much less high- than low-fidelity data. In order to extract as much information as possible from all available data, we here introduce an approach which aims to improve the quality of the data through denoising. We investigate the possibilities that it offers in the case of the prediction of the band gap using both limited experimental data and density-functional theory relying on different exchange-correlation functionals. After analyzing the raw data thoroughly, we explore different ways to combine the data into training sequences and analyze the effect of the chosen denoiser. We also study the effect of applying the denoising procedure several times until convergence. Finally, we compare our approach with various existing methods to exploit multi-fidelity data and show that it provides an interesting improvement.},

  abstract={Traditionally, chemistry problems are solved by means of a deductive approach. The question to be addressed is typically related to the value of a property that is either measured experimentally, computed using quantum-chemistry software, or (more recently) predicted using a machine-learned model. In this paper, we demonstrate that an inductive approach can be adopted using End-to-End (E2E) machine learning. This approach is illustrated for tackling the following chemistry problems: (i) determine the fully coordinated (FC) and undercoordinated (UC) atoms in a molecule with one missing atom, (ii) identify the type of atom that is missing in such an incomplete molecule, and (iii) predict the direction of a reaction between two molecules according to an existing dataset. The E2E approach leads to accuracies higher than 99%, 98%, and 93% for these three problems, respectively. Finally, in order to achieve such accuracies, a descriptor for the molecules, called bag of clusters, is introduced and compared with a series previously proposed descriptors, highlighting a series of advantages.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
